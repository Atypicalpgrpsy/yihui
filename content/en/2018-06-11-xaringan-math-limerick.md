When my colleague Kevin Kuo asked a question about a problematic LaTeX math expression in a **xaringan** presentation, Claus EkstrÃ¸m [replied with an amusing limerick](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/146):

> When dollars appear it's a sign  
that your code does not quite align  
Ensure that your math  
in xaringan hath  
been placed on a single long line

I laughed out loud. That was much better than my ["official" documentation](https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#16)!
