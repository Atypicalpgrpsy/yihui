The **knitr** support in RStudio was added since 0.96. You can download the [latest version](http://www.rstudio.org/download/) and enjoy the one-click PDF compilation in RStudio through **knitr**.

You are free to choose different engines to knit or weave the document, such as `Sweave` or `knitr` (please note the default is `Sweave` and you may want to [change it to `knitr`](http://stackoverflow.com/q/27592837/559676)), and you can also use different LaTeX backends such as `pdflatex` or `xelatex`.

Remember you do not have to use LaTeX; I encourage you to try [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) there, which is much easier to learn and use than LaTeX.
