title: Feel the Pain of Installing and Using Other LaTeX Distributions

Some developers may doubt if I'm just reinventing wheels. I certainly don't want to reinvent wheels for no reason. As I said on the homepage, my own pain with existing LaTeX distributions is that they are often too big, and the documentation, while being comprehensive and useful, usually does not highlight the most useful part to me (how to find and install a missing package). I also dislike the fact that they often require `sudo` (on *nix) to manage LaTeX packages. For personal computers, I don't see any point of requiring `sudo`, considering the fact that TeX Live can be a self-contained folder that can be placed anywhere on your computer.

On this page, I'll let other users share their stories of installing and managing LaTeX. First I want to show a list of painful cases that I was aware of:

- [Why LaTeX is such a bloated system?](https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=395863)

- [Is there a lightweight implementation/distribution of TeX for Mac OSX?](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/43862/9128)

- [Installing (a lightweight version of) latex on an external hard drive](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/81802/9128)

- texlive-full is [too big](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles/pull/130#issuecomment-313732003), and [just too big](https://github.com/road2stat/liftr/issues/25) for Docker images

- [Which LaTeX to install on Linux?](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/18939/9128)

- Missing LaTeX packages confuse users [forever](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/359), [forever](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/1076), and it takes [forever](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/763805846807547904) to figure them out and install. [Error messages](https://stackoverflow.com/q/47400936/559676) can also be confusing.
